To install `ultralytics==8.0.196` in an Anaconda environment, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open Anaconda Prompt**: This is the command line interface that comes with Anaconda.

2. **Activate Your Conda Environment**: If you have an existing environment where you want to install the package, activate it using:

   conda activate your_environment_name

   Replace `your_environment_name` with the name of your Anaconda environment. If you don't have an environment set up, you can create one using:

   conda create --name your_environment_name python=3.8
   conda activate your_environment_name


3. **Install pip**: Ensure that `pip` is installed in your environment. You can install it using:

   conda install pip


4. **Install `ultralytics` using pip**: Use `pip` to install the specific version of the `ultralytics` package:

   pip install ultralytics==8.0.196

### Verifying Installation

After installation, you can verify that `ultralytics` has been installed correctly by checking its version:


python -c "import ultralytics; print(ultralytics.__version__)"


This command should output `8.0.196` if the installation was successful.


Ensure Jupyter is Using the Correct Kernel

Make sure that Jupyter is using the same environment where `ultralytics` is installed. You can install the `ipykernel` package and add the environment as a Jupyter kernel:

1. **Install `ipykernel`**:

   pip install ipykernel


2. **Add the Environment to Jupyter**:

   python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"

   Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.

3. **Select the Kernel in Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook.
   - Go to `Kernel` -> `Change kernel`.
   - Select `Python (myenv)`.
